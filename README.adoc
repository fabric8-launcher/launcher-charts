== Installing the Launcher

This README will explain how to install the Launcher using the Helm Chart found in this folder.
This Helm Chart that will create all the necessary services in OpenShift to run the application.

=== Requisites

Before you start any installation make sure that:

- You've got https://helm.sh/docs/intro/install/[Helm] installed
- You are logged in using `oc login`
- You have created a project (eg. by using `oc new-project`)

=== Installation

To install the Launcher Chart run the following (assuming your current directory is the same as where this README lives):

[source,bash]
----
helm install launcher ./helm/launcher --disable-openapi-validation
----

Now by default this won't actually install a fully working version of the Launcher because if you want more than the
possibility of downloading code and you also want the Launcher to push code to Git and deploy the applications on
OpenShift you will need to configure one of the Authentication mechanisms.

=== Configuration

All possible configuration options can be found here: link:stable/launcher/values.yaml[values.yaml]

Single configuration values can be set by passing them on the command line, like `--set key+value`, but that soon
becomes unwieldy so in that case it's best to create a .yaml file with al the required settings and pass them  like this:

[source,bash]
----
-f ./my-config-values.yaml
----

=== Authentication

There are 4 possible authentication methods that can be configured: KeyCloak, OAuth and direct (single-user) token or
basic authentication. Each of those options needs different values to be set, which we'll explain below.

==== KeyCloak

The `auth` configuration setting must be set to `keycloak` for this. Then you need to configure the settings in the
`keycloak` section. Take a look at the link:keycloak-openshiftio-values.yaml file to get some idea what's needed.

*TBD*: Some more documentation.

==== OAuth

The `auth` configuration setting must be set to `oauth` for this. Then you need to configure the settings in the
`oauth` and `gitProvider` sections. Read this https://github.com/fabric8-launcher/launcher-application/blob/master/README.md#setup-using-oauth-oauth-mode[OAuth Setup] explanation.
You can also take a look at the contents of this file: link:local-crc-dev-values.yaml to get an idea.

*TBD*: Some more documentation.

==== Token or Username/Password

*Warning:* _This authentication method is only for local development purposes. It can only ever handle a single a single
user and is therefore not suited for non-local deployment._

The `auth` configuration setting must be set to `direct` for this. Then you need to configure the settings in the
`openshift` and `legacyGitProvider` sections. Read this https://github.com/fabric8-launcher/launcher-application/blob/master/README.md#setup-git-providers-default-credentials-token-mode[Token Setup]
explanation.

=== Stable Release

By default the Chart will use the latest versions from master for both the Launcher application and the Welcome
Application, if you want to use the latest stable versions instead add the following argument to the `helm install`
command above:

[source,bash]
----
-f ./helm/release-values.yaml
----
